Marko Haim <Haim.Marko at comverse.com> reported that access lists
were being reordered.  Very tricky bug, but fixed now.

Jay Austad <austad at signal15.com> reported that get('no cdp enable')
didn't work.  Oops, I forgot to document something: "no" is ignored
as a word when parsing configurations.  It's documented now.
